<!-- ProductList.tsx: -->
Purpose: This file likely contains a React component responsible for rendering a list of products.
Functionality: It may receive an array of product data as props and iterate over them to render individual Product components.

<!-- Products/content/UI -->
ImageContainer.tsx:Contain product images.
LinkContainer.tsx: Contain product Links etc.
textBOx: conatian store data.
VideoContainer: Contains videos of store.

<!-- MainLayout: -->

Purpose: This sub-folder contains components related to the main layout of the application.
<!-- Container.tsx: -->
Purpose: This file likely contains a container component for the overall layout structure of the application.
Functionality: It may define the basic layout structure, such as a header, footer, and content area.
<!-- Header.tsx: -->
Purpose: This file likely contains a React component for the header section of the layout.
Functionality: It may include navigation links, a search bar, user authentication controls, etc.
<!-- Footer.tsx: -->
Purpose: This file likely contains a React component for the footer section of the layout.
Functionality: It may include links to social media, contact information, copyright notice, etc.

3.useCases/Products:

<!-- ProductsAPI.ts: -->
Purpose: This file likely serves as an API client responsible for fetching product data from a backend server.
Functionality: It may contain functions or classes that make HTTP requests to retrieve product information, handle responses, and return data to other parts of the application.
Example: The file may include functions like getProducts, getProductById, createProduct, updateProduct, deleteProduct, etc., depending on the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations supported by the API.

<!-- ProductsActions.ts: -->
Purpose: This file likely defines actions that interact with product-related data within the application's state management system (e.g., Redux).
Functionality: It may contain action creators responsible for creating Redux actions related to products, such as fetching products, adding a new product, updating product details, deleting a product, etc.
Example: The file may include action creator functions like fetchProducts, addProduct, updateProduct, deleteProduct, etc.

<!-- ProductsReducers.ts: -->
Purpose: This file likely contains Redux reducers that handle changes to product-related state in the application.
Functionality: It may define reducer functions that specify how the application's state should change in response to product-related actions dispatched by action creators.
Example: The file may include reducer functions like productsReducer, which takes the current state and an action as input and returns the new state based on the action type.

<!-- ProductsUtils.ts: -->
Purpose: This file likely contains utility functions related to product data manipulation or processing.
Functionality: It may include helper functions for formatting product data, performing calculations (e.g., calculating total price), filtering or sorting products, validating product inputs, etc.
Example: The file may include functions like formatProductData, calculateTotalPrice, filterProductsByCategory, validateProductInput, etc.

<!-- 4.ui_framework -->
<!-- Router.tsx: -->
Purpose: This file likely serves as the main router configuration component for the application.
Functionality: It may define the routes and route configurations using a routing library such as React Router.
Example: The file may contain code that specifies the different routes in the application, including their paths, corresponding components, and any additional route-specific configurations (e.g., authentication requirements, route guards, etc.).
Usage: This component is typically rendered at the root of the application to handle navigation and route rendering based on the current URL.

<!-- RoutesList.tsx: -->
Purpose: This file likely contains a list of route configurations or definitions used by the router component.
Functionality: It may define an array or object containing route configurations, including route paths, component mappings, and any additional route-specific properties.
Usage: The router component (Router.tsx) can import and use the route configurations defined in this file to render the appropriate components based on the current URL path.
